# Bradley-Fayyad-Reina-BFR_Clustering_Algorithm_Python
In this project, I have implemented the Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm for clustering synthetic datasets. The goal of this assignment is to gain familiarity with the clustering process, different distance measurements, and the implementation of the BFR algorithm.
